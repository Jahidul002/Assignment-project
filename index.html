                <h1>Their Lives Depends On Your Donation</h1>
                <p>Actually, small donations can make a huge difference. For example, an anti-malaria bed net costs only
                    $2.50 and protects two people for up to three years. The costs of meeting basic human needs in the
                    developing world are most often far less than the costs for those same services and supplies in the
                    developed world.</p>
